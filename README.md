# End-to-end-Sequence-Labeling-via-Bi-directional-LSTM-CNNs-CRF-Tutorial

This is a PyTorch tutorial for the ACL'16 paper 
[**End-to-end Sequence Labeling via Bi-directional LSTM-CNNs-CRF**](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1101)

This repository includes

* [**IPython Notebook of the tutorial**](https://github.com/jayavardhanr/End-to-end-Sequence-Labeling-via-Bi-directional-LSTM-CNNs-CRF-Tutorial/blob/master/Named_Entity_Recognition-LSTM-CNN-CRF-Tutorial.ipynb)
* Data folder
* Setup Instructions file
* Pretrained models directory (The notebook will automatically download pre-trained models into this directory, as required)


### Installation
The best way to install pytorch is via the [**pytorch webpage**](http://pytorch.org/)
